# DailyPostBot

This bot will create a new post every day (or another time duration of your choice), and delete the previous post if no comments were made on it.

# Requirements

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads)
* [PRAW](http://praw.readthedocs.io) (use `pip`)

# Usage

Run the script. It will walk you through obtaining all necessary credentials and files. After everything has been defined, the bot will save these to the folder the script is is, then will reference that for further startups. If you need to change something, either delete the file that needs changing and recreate the file, or stop the script, edit the file, then restart the script.
